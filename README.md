# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

After reviewing the students_completed.csv file, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty with Thomas High school for the ninth graders.  Therefore, I am tasked with the following:

- Replace the math and reading scores for this school with NaNs.
- Repeat the school district analysis.
- Find how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Summary

- Original Analysis

    The top 5 schools were all Charter and the bottom 5 were all District.  The Charter schools had less students than the District.   The overall passing percentage was at least 90% for the top 5 schools.   Each school had a better reading passing percentage than math. Overall, schools with 2000+ students have a very low passing percentage.
